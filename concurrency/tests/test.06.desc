## This test tests the queue implementation
## between the reader thread and the main
## thread
## 
## Input: A series of TRX events, followed by a
##        BLK event and an END event with a 
##        delay in the input at the BLK event.
##        this causes the main thread to run 
##        and use up the input.
## 
## Part 1: Basic functionality
## The output of your program with the 
## "Thread..." and "Received ..." statesments
## stripped out should match the solution's
## output with "Thread..." and "Received ..." 
## statesments stripped out.
## 
## Part 2: Receive ordering
## The order of all receive statements generated
## by your program should be the same as in the 
## solution.
