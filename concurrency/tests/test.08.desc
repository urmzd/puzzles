## This test tests the queue implementation
## between the reader thread and the main
## thread
## 
## Input: A series of TRX events, followed by an
##        EPOCH event, a MINE event and an END 
##        event with a delay in the input at the 
##        EPOCH event. This causes the main 
##        thread to run and use up the input.
## 
## Part 1: Basic functionality
## The output of your program with the 
## "Thread..." and "Received ..." statesments
## stripped out should match the solution's
## output with "Thread..." and "Received ..." 
## statesments stripped out.
## 
## Part 2: Receive ordering
## The order of all receive statements generated
## by your program should be the same as in the 
## solution.
