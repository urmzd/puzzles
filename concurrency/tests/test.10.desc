##
## This test tests the queue between the reader
## and the main thread by causing the main thread
## to use up all the input after each event. 
## This is done by delaying each event in the 
## input.
## 
## Input: A series of TRX events followed by an
##        END event
## 
## Part 1: Basic functionality
## The output of your program with the 
## "Thread..." and "Received ..." statesments
## stripped out should match the solution's
## output with "Thread..." and "Received ..." 
## statesments stripped out.
## 
## Part 2: Receive ordering
## The output of your program with the 
## "Thread..." statesments stripped out 
## should match the solution's output 
## with "Thread..." statesments stripped out.
