## This tests the concurreny of your 
## implementation
## 
## Input: A long series (100+) of transactions
##        with random delays in input introduced
##        throughout.  No two runs should be the
##        same.
## 
## Part 1: Basic functionality
## The output of your program with the 
## "Thread..." and "Received ..." statesments
## stripped out should match the solution's
## output with "Thread..." and "Received ..." 
## statesments stripped out.
## 
## Part 2: Receive ordering
## The output of your program with the 
## "Thread..." statesments stripped out 
## should be different each time with respect
## to the occurrence of the Receive statements.
## I.e., two consecutive runs of the program 
## Are very unlikely to produce the same output.
## If this test does fail try rerunning it.  If
## it fails twice in a row, then your program has
## very restrictive concurrency.
